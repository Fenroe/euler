# Project Euler Solutions

# Threes and Fives

Only issue with this was a misunderstanding on whether the final value was inclusive or not

# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Again, not worth talking about

# Largest Prime Factor

Once I understood this was specifically a challenge to find a number's prime factors it all fell into place. The absurdly large number to work towards got me to think beyond brute force and instead use a more sensible mathematical approach

# Largest Palindrome

Could not find a formula for finding palindromes that was easy to understand without a background in maths. The approach I landed on finds the result quickly so it isn't a problem

# Smallest Sum

My initial approach could be tweaked to get a faster result
